# Design

<!-- give an overview of your project's design -->
<!-- describe the reasoning behind your group's design and wireframe -->
<!-- include other centralized decisions like fonts, palates, ... -->

This design is for Maurice's personal portfolio homepage. He needs a website to
show his achievements and coding skills. A way to keep contact with employers,
clients and programers if they want to ask him questions or try to find a
collaborator. This will help him to improve his coding skills and find a job or
start his own company later. My design will highlight the contact information
and portfolio.
