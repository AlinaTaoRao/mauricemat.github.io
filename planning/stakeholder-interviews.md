## 2. Stakeholder interviews

### My questions and the stakeholder's answers I noted

1 - **What are your main objectives when you visit a home page?**

Firstly, I want to know what the webpage is about. It means the purpose of this
website. Secondly, I want to know if this website has anything that might
interest me.

2 - **What do you put forward when you present yourself as a junior developer?**

Firstly, I present who I am. Secondly, I present my porto-folio and what I do.
Thirdly, I communicate my contact details so people can get in touch with me.

3 - **Would you like communicating your educational background on your
homepage?**

No. I would not like communicating my educational background on my homepage. I
prefer sharing the link of my LinkedIn profile. So people can get more
information there. I think is efficient in that way.

4 - **What did you study?**

I studied bio-chemistry. Now I want to become a great Front-End Developer.

5 - **Why do you want to become a developer?**

When the pandemic (COVID-19) started, I realized how important it was to be able
to work remotely. And I noticed that with jobs like web development, this is
possible. I then decided to study something that can allow me to work remotely.

The second reason is that today, digital is everywhere. And digital skills are
highly needed nowadays in the job market.

The third reason is the fact that with digital, you can change many things in
the world for the better.

6 - **What are your current challenge?**

I need to learn more programmes. I started from zero. So I need to work hard to
improve my skills.

7 - **Do you want to work on your own or be employee?**

Yes. But from the beginning, I would like to find a job after my cursus at HYF.
I would like to work at a big company or any relevant company to gain
professional experience. After a few years, I will start my own business.

## User interview

### My questions and the user's answers I noted

1 - **When you visit my homepage, what do you look first?**

What I look first are pictures and the navigation bar.

2 - **What are the information that you find not useful in any junior developer
homepage?**

I do not have a right answer. Because I have not visited many junior
web-developer homepages yet. I have only visited few junior web-developer
homepages. And I found them quite attractive. The design was nice. I noticed
that they had navigation bars, social media icons and pictures.

3- **Do you pay attention to design when you visit a webpage?**

Yes. For me, the design is the most important. It counts for 100%. If I do not
find the design of a homepage attractive, I will stop visiting the website.

4 - **Do you give up easily when you face any difficulty?**

It depends on the situation. But most of the times, I try to resolve issues that
I face.

5 - **What do you think about Open source?**

In my opinion, Open source is a good idea because people in different locations
around the world can work together. With Open source, everyone can access to the
source and contribute. In the future, I would like contributing in an Open
source project if I have time and opportunity.

6 - **What are your criteria in terms of job opportunities?** **Do you pay more
attention to what aspect of a job announcement?**

First, the missions of the position. Secondly, The location. Thirdly, the skills
and implications that the job requires. Fourth, I ask to myself if I am
interested in the job. Fifth, the salary.

The salary is the last aspect because as a junior web-developer, I do not have
enough professional experience at the moment.

7 - **Do you like working in team or alone?**

I like working in team in the big projects. I like also working alone when the
task or project is not big. I am used to working in team. Before HYF, I often
worked in team in a laboratory.

8 - **What is you fear concerning professional career?**

I am apprehensive about working overtime. I am afraid of overtime.

9 - **What is your next project?**

To build my homepage.
