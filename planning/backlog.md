# Backlog

<!-- A collection of user stories for your project. Stories inside of each priority level are not necessarily in order. You and your team will decide when to develop each story by drawing out your [Story Sequencing](#story-sequencing). -->

This backlog shows user stories for Maurice's project.

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

- **As a layman user,**:

  - I want to see who own this website, so that I can call his/her name.
  - I want to see what the website is about, so that I can decide to stay or
    leave.
  - I want to see a navbar, so that I can navigate comfortably to different
    webpage or section.
  - I want to see the contact information, so that I can contact the owner.

  - [ ] _there is a logo on top of the page, it shows the owner's name_
  - [ ] _there is a paragraph explaining the purpose on the page_
  - [ ] _there is a navbar to different page or section_
  - [ ] _there is a footer where they can contact the owner_

- **As a collaborator user,**:

  - I want to see the coding language of the owner, so that I can decide if the
    owner the right collaborator that I'm looking for.
  - I want to see the skill level of the owner, so that I can decide if the
    owner the right collaborator that I'm looking for.

  - [ ] _there is a language section on the homepage_
  - [ ] _there are showcases to prove the owner's coding level_

- **Aa a employer user,**:

  - I want to see his/her portfolio, so that I can judge if he/she is qualified.
  - I want to see his/her resume, so that I can know more about him/her.
  - I want to see his/her location, so that I know if he/she is near by our company.

  - [ ] _there is a portfolio section on the homepage_
  - [ ] _there is a way to download resume or read it_
  - [ ] _there is Location on the homepage_

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...

## Could-Haves

would be really cool ... if there's time:

- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- **user story name**: As a [type of user] I want to [do something] so that [I
  achieve some goal]
  - Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of
    consequences should occur]
  - ...
- ...
